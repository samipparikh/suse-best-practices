  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para> SAP Cloud Platform is an enterprise Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from SAP, with
   comprehensive application development services and capabilities. It enables customers to achieve
   business agility, create a truly integrated and optimized enterprise, and accelerate digital
   transformation across the business, without the need to invest in and maintain an on-premise
   infrastructure. However, some customers who could benefit from SAP Cloud Platform want to run
   cloud services in their own data centers to meet requirements for governance, security, data
   privacy, IP protection and legal restrictions. This is why SAP offers SAP Cloud Platform, private
   edition. SAP Cloud Platform, private edition is based on SAP's public cloud offering, but can be
   deployed on the customer&#8217;s premises. </para>
  <para> Based on open standards, SAP Cloud Platform offers complete flexibility and control over
   your choice of clouds, frameworks, and applications. SAP Cloud Platform runs on top of an
   Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) layer. </para>
  <para> This document provides guidance on how to prepare an IaaS environment for SAP Cloud
   Platform. It includes an overview of the architecture and key aspects of the IaaS platform based
   on SUSE products and is specifically designed for SAP Cloud Platform. </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-iaas-architecture-for-sap-cloud-platform">
  <title>IaaS Architecture for SAP Cloud Platform</title>
  <para> SAP Cloud Platform is built to fulfill the requirements of a modern future-proof data
   center where applications are created on a container base. This enables an agile operation
   according to a DevOps approach. SAP Cloud Platform runs on top of an IaaS layer, which provides
   all needed physical resources (compute, storage and networking). </para>
  <para> The IaaS platform is based on SUSE OpenStack Cloud and SUSE Enterprise Storage, and is
   specifically designed and configured for SAP Cloud Platform. </para>
  <para> SAP Cloud Platform uses cloud-native workloads. The underlying IaaS needs to be optimized
   for these workloads. This optimization is the result of a long-term collaboration of SAP and
   SUSE. It provides the right products and the right configuration for a reliable SAP Cloud
   Platform. The IaaS platform is based on commodity x86 rack servers for cost-efficiency and to
   avoid vendor lock-in. </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-high-level-architecture">
   <title>High-level Architecture</title>
   <para> A key design aspect for scalability and high availability is that, regardless of the size
    of a production landscape, all components are evenly distributed across three different
    independent areas. One single area can fail without an impact to the availability of a service.
    This concept is called 'Failure Domain' (FD), and is described in detail in the chapter <xref
     linkend="sec-failure-domains"/>
   </para>
   <para> SAP Cloud Platform is based on the Scale-Out approach, see also <xref
     linkend="sec-scalability"/>. </para>
   <para>
    <?asciidoc-pagebreak?>
   </para>
   <para> SAP Cloud Platform consists of three different layers. </para>

   <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Application Layer:</emphasis> This is the layer where the applications,
    services and the platform (for example CloudFoundry) for providing these services run. </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Control Layer:</emphasis> These are the services needed to provide the
    IaaS. They are invisible for the applications. </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Storage Layer:</emphasis> This is where the persistent data is stored. </para>
   <para> Each layer has specific requirements to ensure its own availability, and needs to be
    distributed across all Failure Domains. </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-failure-domains">
   <title>Failure Domains</title>
   <para> Failure Domains are physical demarcations each with its own independent fire compartment,
    power supply and networking infrastructure. </para>
   <para> The infrastructure for SAP Cloud Platform needs to be distributed over three Failure
    Domains. This ensures that one single Failure Domain can fail without impacting the availability
    of a service. </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-high-availability">
   <title>High Availability</title>
   <para> High availability is delivered on multiple levels in the IaaS stack. The design principle
    is to ensure fault isolation so that an error in a Failure Domain does not affect the global
    service. The availability of each respective layer is realized in different ways. </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Application Layer:</emphasis> SAP Cloud Platform ensures that the
    service is available (including restarting or relocating). It chooses the right available
    resources for these services. The availability of an application is the responsibility of SAP
    Cloud Platform (PaaS). This can be archived by a "cloud-native" design of the application
    itself. </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Control Layer:</emphasis> To use SAP Cloud Platform in a production
    environment, it is mandatory to ensure its high availability. These control layer components
    (for example message broker, databases and API services) are distributed across all three
    Failure Domains and are clustered with SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension. </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Storage Layer:</emphasis> SUSE Enterprise Storage has built-in high
    availability by design, and is using three replicas distributed across all three Failure
    Domains. SUSE Enterprise Storage provides self-healing and auto balancing features. </para>

   <para> In the SAP Cloud Platform the scale-out principle is used. Additional servers are added to
    expand the environment. </para>

    FD symmetrically. Ideally, all newly-added servers are identical and have the same
    configuration. </para>

    sized so that they do not need to be extended. </para>
